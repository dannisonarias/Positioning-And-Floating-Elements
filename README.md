# Positioning-And-Floating-Elements
This assignment consists of making a clone of a New York Times article page.

> A Newyork times page clone using only Floats to align items. We used the guidelines from the [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org) curriculum, as well as [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for this project.

> The HTML was validated using the [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)
> The CSS was validated with stickler. 

## Built With

- CSS Float
- Visual Studio Code

## Live Demo

## Getting Started

This is a Newyork Times news webpage clone. You can click the elements and view the page, but nothing will work because it's only for showcasing positioning and floating elements.
